## This is the ultimate city guide. Have fun!

The **Passage** Cinema is very beautiful and shows *good* movies.

## places to avoid

Julian: you should definitely avoid Landungsbr√ºcken at new years eve besides that I personally would avoid Reeperbahn but thats a kind of controversial choice and depends on your decision because its a very popular famuos or infamous place to go out

## quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
